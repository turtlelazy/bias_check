This headline is misleading as his sleeping was not the cause of the shooting. The suspect was shot for resisting arrest, taking a taser, and shooting it at an officer, granted while running away and having his back turned. The police shooting was not justified, and hence charges were brought. The point here is the article headline does not fit the story. Most stories on this website are well-sourced and factual but clearly left-biased."

One can argue this is more accurate and 538\u2019s early track record proved it was. However, in 2016 they gave President Trump a 29% chance of winning. This does not mean they were wrong because they still had a 29% chance of being correct, but they clearly were not very close on this one with their methods."
