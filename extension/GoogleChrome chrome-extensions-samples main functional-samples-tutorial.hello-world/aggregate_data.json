One can argue this is more accurate and 538\u2019s early track record proved it was. However, in 2016 they gave President Trump a 29% chance of winning. This does not mean they were wrong because they still had a 29% chance of being correct, but they clearly were not very close on this one with their methods."

While looking through the articles, one, in particular, caught my attention.

There is no real substance to the claim at this point, which came from an early draft of a \u201cwhat if\u201d style memo that never reached any official level.

While again, this may reflect the individual author\u2019s rather than editorial intent, it\u2019s easy enough to use external sources instead. That said, the quality of the content on the site is very high, and except for a slight caveat on the bias and self-sourcing, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend ATTN to anyone looking for a solid news source."
